Time To create your Weather APP

Follow the instructions to create your app to fetch weather's data  like temperature, location ...

 


Instructions

Set Up Your Project:

Create a new folder for your weather app project.
Inside the folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Write HTML Structure:

Open the index.html file in your text editor.
Set up the basic HTML structure with <!DOCTYPE html> and <html> tags.
Inside the <head> tag, add necessary meta tags, including character set and viewport settings.
Link your CSS file (styles.css) using <link> tag inside the <head> section.
Create a <body> section to contain the content of your app.
Style Your App with CSS:

Open the styles.css file in your text editor.
Define styles for the various elements of your weather app, including containers, text, and backgrounds.
Use classes and IDs to target specific elements and apply styles accordingly.
Consider using media queries to make your app responsive to different screen sizes.
Write JavaScript to Fetch Weather Data:

Open the script.js file in your text editor.
Define a function or event handler to fetch weather data from a weather API.
Choose a free weather API provider such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or MetaWeather.
Use the fetch() method or an AJAX library like Axios to make a request to the API and retrieve weather information.
Parse the JSON response and extract relevant data such as temperature, description, and location.
Update the HTML content dynamically to display the retrieved weather information.
Test Your App:

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view your weather app.
Test different cities or locations to ensure that the weather data is being fetched and displayed correctly.
Check for any styling issues or errors in the console.
